# To-Do:

## Build a similar page (not the exact same one) that can be used for a small/personal business on selling something like baked goods, toys, crafts, etc.

- While designing the page, try to follow some good design principles:
  - simplicity
  - consistency
  - visual hierarchy
  - typography
  - responsive design
  - spacing
  - alignment and layout structure
  - color theory

* The way forward:
  - Prepare a draft design, set your ultimate goal, budget time
  - Split responsibilities and set up meetings beyond the class time
  - Prepare a plan to complete the task
